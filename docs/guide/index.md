  A workflow tool for managing git worktrees and tmux windows as isolated
  development environments for AI agents

# What is workmux?

workmux is a giga opinionated zero-friction workflow tool for managing
[git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) and tmux windows as
isolated development environments. Also supports [kitty](/guide/kitty),
[WezTerm](/guide/wezterm), and [Zellij](/guide/zellij) (experimental). Perfect
for running multiple AI agents in parallel without conflict.

**Philosophy**: Build on tools you already use. tmux/zellij/kitty/etc. for
windowing, git for worktrees, your agent for coding — workmux orchestrates the
rest.

## Why workmux?

**Parallel workflows.** Work on multiple features at the same time, each with
its own AI agent. No stashing, no branch switching, no conflicts.

**One window per task.** A natural mental model. Each has its own terminal
state, editor session, dev server, and AI agent. Context switching is switching
tabs.

**Automated setup.** New worktrees start broken (no `.env`, no `node_modules`,
no dev server). workmux can copy config files, symlink dependencies, and run
install commands on creation.

**One-command cleanup.** `workmux merge` handles the full lifecycle: merge the
branch, delete the worktree, close the tmux window, remove the local branch. Or
go next level and use the [`/merge` skill](/guide/skills#merge) to let your
agent commit, rebase, and merge autonomously.

**Terminal workflow.** Build on your terminal setup instead of yet another
agentic GUI that won't exist next year. If you don't have one yet,
[tmux might be worth picking up](https://raine.dev/blog/my-tmux-setup/). Also
supports [Kitty](/guide/kitty), [WezTerm](/guide/wezterm), and
[Zellij](/guide/zellij).

## Features

- Create git worktrees with matching tmux windows (or kitty/WezTerm/Zellij tabs)
  in a single command (`add`)
- Merge branches and clean up everything (worktree, tmux window, branches) in
  one command (`merge`)
- [Dashboard](/guide/dashboard/) for monitoring agents, reviewing changes, and
  sending commands
- [Delegate tasks to worktree agents](/guide/skills#-worktree) with a
  `/worktree` skill
- [Display Claude agent status in tmux window names](/guide/status-tracking)
- Automatically set up your preferred tmux pane layout (editor, shell, watchers,
  etc.)
- Run post-creation hooks (install dependencies, setup database, etc.)
- Copy or symlink configuration files (`.env`, `node_modules`) into new
  worktrees
- [Sandbox agents](/guide/sandbox/) in containers or VMs for enhanced security
- [Automatic branch name generation](/reference/commands/add#automatic-branch-name-generation)
  from prompts using LLM
- Shell completions

## Before and after

workmux turns a multi-step manual workflow into simple commands, making parallel
development workflows practical.

### Without workmux

```bash
# 1. Manually create the worktree and environment
git worktree add ../worktrees/user-auth -b user-auth
cd ../worktrees/user-auth
cp ../../project/.env.example .env
ln -s ../../project/node_modules .
npm install
# ... and other setup steps

# 2. Manually create and configure the tmux window
tmux new-window -n user-auth
tmux split-window -h 'npm run dev'
tmux send-keys -t 0 'claude' C-m
# ... repeat for every pane in your desired layout

# 3. When done, manually merge and clean everything up
cd ../../project
git switch main && git pull
git merge --no-ff user-auth
tmux kill-window -t user-auth
git worktree remove ../worktrees/user-auth
git branch -d user-auth
```

### With workmux

```bash
# Create the environment
workmux add user-auth

# ... work on the feature ...

# Merge and clean up
workmux merge
```

## Why git worktrees?

[Git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) let you have multiple
branches checked out at once in the same repository, each in a separate
directory. This provides two main advantages over a standard single-directory
setup:

- **Painless context switching**: Switch between tasks just by changing
  directories (`cd ../other-branch`). There's no need to `git stash` or make
  temporary commits. Your work-in-progress, editor state, and command history
  remain isolated and intact for each branch.

- **True parallel development**: Work on multiple branches simultaneously
  without interference. You can run builds, install dependencies
  (`npm install`), or run tests in one worktree while actively coding in
  another. This isolation is perfect for running multiple AI agents in parallel
  on different tasks.

In a standard Git setup, switching branches disrupts your flow by requiring a
clean working tree. Worktrees remove this friction. `workmux` automates the
entire process and pairs each worktree with a dedicated tmux window, creating
fully isolated development environments.

## Requirements

- Git 2.5+ (for worktree support)
- tmux (or [WezTerm](/guide/wezterm), [kitty](/guide/kitty), or
  [Zellij](/guide/zellij))

## Inspiration and related tools

workmux is inspired by [wtp](https://github.com/satococoa/wtp), an excellent git
worktree management tool. While wtp streamlines worktree creation and setup,
workmux takes this further by tightly coupling worktrees with tmux window
management.

For managing multiple AI agents in parallel, tools like
[claude-squad](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad) and
[vibe-kanban](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/) offer dedicated
interfaces, like a TUI or kanban board. In contrast, workmux adheres to its
philosophy that **tmux is the interface**, providing a native tmux experience
for managing parallel workflows without requiring a separate interface to learn.
