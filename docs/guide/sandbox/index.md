# Sandbox

workmux provides first-class sandboxing for agents in containers or VMs. Agents are isolated from host secrets like SSH keys, AWS credentials, and other sensitive files. That makes YOLO mode safe to use without risking your host.

Status indicators, the dashboard, spawning agents, and merging all work the same with or without a sandbox. A built-in RPC bridge keeps host-side workmux features in sync with agent activity inside the sandbox.

## Security model

When sandbox is enabled, agents have access to:

- The current worktree directory (read-write)
- The main worktree directory (read-write, for symlink resolution like `CLAUDE.local.md`)
- The shared `.git` directory (read-write, for git operations)
- Agent settings and credentials (see [credentials](./features#credentials))

Host secrets like SSH keys, AWS credentials, and GPG keys are not accessible. Additional directories can be mounted via [`extra_mounts`](./features#extra-mounts).

Outbound network access can be restricted to only approved domains using [network restrictions](./container#network-restrictions) (container backend). When enabled, a CONNECT proxy and iptables firewall work together to block unauthorized connections and prevent access to internal networks.

## Choosing a backend

workmux supports two sandboxing backends:

|                      | Container (Docker/Podman/Apple Container)                                    | Lima VM                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Isolation**        | Process-level (namespaces) or VM-level (Apple Container)                     | Machine-level (virtual machine)                                  |
| **Persistence**      | Ephemeral (new container per session)                                        | Persistent (stateful VMs)                                        |
| **Toolchain**        | Custom Dockerfile or [host commands](./features#host-command-proxying)       | Built-in [Nix & Devbox](./lima#nix-and-devbox-toolchain) support |
| **Credential model** | Shared with host (see [credentials](./features#credentials))                 | Shared with host (see [credentials](./features#credentials))     |
| **Network**          | Optional [restrictions](./container#network-restrictions) (domain allowlist) | Unrestricted                                                     |
| **Platform**         | macOS, Linux (Apple Container: macOS only)                                   | macOS, Linux                                                     |

Container is a good default: it's simple to set up and ephemeral, so no state accumulates between sessions. Choose Lima if you want persistent VMs with built-in Nix/Devbox toolchain support.

## Adding tools to the sandbox

Agents often need project tooling (compilers, linters, build tools) available inside the sandbox. There are several ways to provide this depending on your backend:

| Approach                   | Container | Lima | Details                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Host commands**          | Yes       | Yes  | Proxy specific commands to the host via RPC. See [host command proxying](./features#host-command-proxying).                          |
| **Nix / Devbox toolchain** | No        | Yes  | Declare tools in `devbox.json` or `flake.nix` and they're available automatically. See [toolchain](./lima#nix-and-devbox-toolchain). |
| **Custom provisioning**    | No        | Yes  | Run a shell script at VM creation to install packages. See [custom provisioning](./lima#custom-provisioning).                        |
| **Custom Dockerfile**      | Yes       | No   | Build a custom container image with your tools baked in. See [custom images](./container#custom-images).                             |

## Quick start

### Container backend

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Podman](https://podman.io/), or [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container) (macOS 26+, Apple Silicon), then enable in config:

```yaml
# ~/.config/workmux/config.yaml or .workmux.yaml
sandbox:
  enabled: true
```

The pre-built image is pulled automatically on first run. See the [container backend](./container) page for details.

### Lima VM backend

Install [Lima](https://lima-vm.io/) (`brew install lima`), then enable in config:

```yaml
# ~/.config/workmux/config.yaml or .workmux.yaml
sandbox:
  enabled: true
  backend: lima
```

The VM is created and provisioned automatically on first run. See the [Lima VM backend](./lima) page for details.
