description: Open or switch to a tmux window for an existing worktree
---

# open

Opens or switches to a tmux window for a pre-existing git worktree. If the window already exists, switches to it. If not, creates a new window with the configured pane layout and environment. Accepts multiple names to open several worktrees at once.

```bash
workmux open [name...] [flags]
```

## Arguments

- `[name...]`: One or more worktree names (the directory name, which is also the tmux window name without the prefix). Optional with `--new` when run from inside a worktree.

## Options

| Flag                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-n, --new`                | Force opening in a new window even if one already exists. Creates a duplicate window with a suffix (e.g., `-2`, `-3`). Useful for having multiple terminal views into the same worktree. Cannot be combined with `--session`. |
| `-s, --session`            | Open in session mode, overriding the stored mode. Persists the mode change for subsequent opens. Cannot be combined with `--new`. Only supported with tmux.                                                                   |
| `--run-hooks`              | Re-runs the `post_create` commands (these block window creation).                                                                                                                                                             |
| `--force-files`            | Re-applies file copy/symlink operations. Useful for restoring a deleted `.env` file.                                                                                                                                          |
| `-p, --prompt <text>`      | Provide an inline prompt for AI agent panes.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `-P, --prompt-file <path>` | Provide a path to a file containing the prompt.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `-c, --continue`           | Resume the agent's most recent conversation in this worktree. Injects the appropriate flag for the configured agent (e.g., `--continue` for Claude, `--resume` for Gemini).                                                   |
| `-e, --prompt-editor`      | Open your editor to write the prompt interactively.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `--prompt-file-only`       | Write the prompt file to the worktree without injecting it into agent commands.                                                                                                                                               |

## What happens

1. Verifies that a worktree with `<name>` exists.
2. If a tmux window exists and `--new` is not set, switches to it.
3. Otherwise, creates a new tmux window (with suffix if duplicating). If the worktree was originally created with `--session`, the window is recreated in its own session.
4. (If specified) Runs file operations and `post_create` hooks.
5. Sets up your configured tmux pane layout.
6. Automatically switches your tmux client to the new window.

## Examples

```bash
# Open or switch to a window for an existing worktree
workmux open user-auth

# Force open a second window for the same worktree (creates user-auth-2)
workmux open user-auth --new

# Open a new window for the current worktree (run from within the worktree)
workmux open --new

# Open in session mode (converts from window mode if needed)
workmux open user-auth --session

# Resume the agent's last conversation
workmux open user-auth --continue

# Resume and send a follow-up prompt
workmux open user-auth --continue -p "Continue implementing the login flow"

# Open and re-run dependency installation
workmux open user-auth --run-hooks

# Open and restore configuration files
workmux open user-auth --force-files

# Open multiple worktrees at once
workmux open user-auth api-refactor bugfix-login
```
