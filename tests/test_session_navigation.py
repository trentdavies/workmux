"""Tests for session navigation scenarios during cleanup operations.

These tests verify that session-mode cleanup generates correct navigation
commands in the deferred scripts. The headless test environment cannot fully
test client-attached navigation (switch-client requires a PTY-attached
terminal), but we can verify:

  1. The deferred script content is correct (via RUST_LOG capture)
  2. The end state is correct (session killed, worktree cleaned up)

For full navigation testing (verifying the user actually lands on the right
session after remove/merge), manual testing is required because tmux
switch-client needs a client that headless test environments don't provide.

Pseudo-client attachment via `script -q /dev/null tmux attach` is possible
but fragile and platform-dependent, so we test script content instead.

Mixed-mode navigation (session worktree navigating to a window-mode target
during merge) also requires manual testing: tmux's window_exists_by_full_name
only checks the current session's windows, so a window-mode target in another
session can't be detected when running from inside the source session.

    Unlike run_workmux_command which runs from the test session, this sends
    the command to a pane inside the target session. This allows testing
    behavior that depends on being inside the session (e.g.,
    is_inside_matching_target detection in cleanup.rs).

    The command is executed via a script file to avoid tmux send-keys line
    length limits. Exit code, stdout, and stderr are captured to files and
    returned after the command completes.

    When rust_log is set, XDG_STATE_HOME is redirected to a temp directory
    so the log file can be read back. workmux writes tracing output to a
    log file (not stderr), so the log content is appended to stderr in the
    returned result.

    Note: After the command completes, the session may be killed by deferred
    scripts (e.g., after workmux remove). The exit code and output are
    captured before deferred scripts run (they have a 300ms sleep), so they
    are still available.
